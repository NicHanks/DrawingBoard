# Overview

The Java language is an object-oriented language that is used for embedded and application development. Java requires the use of a compiler and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which can both be obtained by installing the Java Development Kit (JDK). Compiled code (often with a .class or .jar extension) will run on any computer that has a JVM. Java contains a substantial library which includes many classes for data structures (Java Collection Framework), file management, and threading. In Java, every file contains a single class. A static main function is created in one of the classes and is used to provide a starting point for the program.

# Development Environment

Install the latest version of either JDK (commercial) or OpenJDK (open source) from Oracle. In industry, there are license considerations between these two options. For your work in this course, either choice is acceptable. Make sure that the Java compiler and virtual machine tools are in your environment path.

You can either integrate Java into Visual Studio Code or run the Java tools (javac and java) from within the Visual Studio Code terminal window. As another option, you can use a tool like IntelliJ (free community version) to develop and run Java code.

Download Java (commercial) -> [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-mac) 
To download an open source version of Java, use [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/)
Integrate Java into vs code -> [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java)
If you are going with jetbrains than go to -> [jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

Also, you can get a 1 min intro to java by pulling up the command pallet and typing "Java: Tips for Beginners"
